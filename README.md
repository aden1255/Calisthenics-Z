## Benefits of Calisthenic Training

### What are Calisthenic Excercises?

Calisthenic Excercises are physical movements that require a person to use their muscles to fight against the force of gravity pushing down amongst them. 

### Basic Types of Movements

**Pull-Ups**, the movement of pulling one's chin over the hands on a bar utilizing the muscles in the user's biceps and back.

**Push-Ups**, the movement of pushing one's body from a fixed position on one's stomach with bent elbows up, straightening them, pushing the body up, utilizing the muscles in the user's pectorals and triceps.

Although these are the basic excercises almost everyone can do, their intensity and difficulty can be increased further through their harder variations.

### Overall Benefits of Calisthenic Excercises

Doing high repetitions of movements like Push-Ups, Sit-Ups, and Pull-Ups cause great fatigue on the body and requires the muscles to build up **Endurance**. Over time with continued excercise the body will be forced to build up the endurance neccessary to continue these movements for higher repetitions and helps increase one's cardiovascular health as performing calisthenic exercises requires compound movements, the utilization of multiple muscles at the same time, which requires much oxygen and blood circulation to achieve. Calisthenics are also great at increasing one's physical **Strength** as, when done correctly, the muscles are pushed until failure, allowing the muscles to break down and micro tears to form. This in turn allows for greater strength to be achieved after the muscle's recovery, as the body will naturally repair the tears of the used muscles however, the repairs will make them stronger and allow the body to adapt to this new strain the muscles are forced on. Calisthenics also build great **Muscle Coordination** as they force the muscles to learn to fire in unison with one another as a compound movement. (Take for example the basic Pull-Up, to perform this movement the muscles are forced to fire the biceps, back, and abdominals at the same time and in coordination with one another creating a compound movement. The abdominals tighten to keep the body stable, while at the same time the biceps pull the hands on the bar down towards them, while the lateral muscles of the back pull on the user's arm to pull the rest of the user's body up.). 

### Harder Variations of Basic Movements keep things Interesting

Calisthenic Excercises can always become more challenging through the implementation of their harder variations, which keep people striving to gain strength to perform these feats. Following will be some harder variations of basic calisthenics:

_Pull Ups_: Archer Pull Ups, Wide Grip Pull Ups, Typewriter Pull Ups, Muscle Ups, One armed Pull Ups

_Push Ups_: Push Ups with arms widened further, Pseudo Planche Push Ups, Tricep Dips, One Handed Push Ups, Handstand Push Ups, Close grip Push Ups

_Sit Ups_: Crunches, Sciccors, 6 Inch Holds, Twist Sit Ups, Leg Raises, Hanging Sit Ups

Here is a list of different [Variations][1] of calisthenic excercises of varying difficulty.
